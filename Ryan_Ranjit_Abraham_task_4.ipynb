    "# Conclusion and Recommendations:\n",
    "Based on the evaluation results, the Gradient Boosting Regressor exhibited the lowest Mean Squared Error among the three models, closely followed by the Random Forest Regressor. These two models demonstrate their ability to capture the underlying patterns in cryptocurrency price data and make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the SVR model had the highest MSE, its performance could potentially improve with hyperparameter tuning or by incorporating additional features. However, the SVR model's current performance suggests that it might not be the best choice for predicting cryptocurrency prices in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Recommendation\n",
    "For predicting cryptocurrency prices for the next day, it is recommended to use the Gradient Boosting Regressor due to its relatively lower Mean Squared Error and consistent predictive performance. However, it's essential to continuously monitor the model's performance as the cryptocurrency market's dynamics can change rapidly."
